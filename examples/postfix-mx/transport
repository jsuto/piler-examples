# Transport map for piler email archiving relay
#
# Route all mail for archive.example.com to the internal worker pool.
# Postfix performs an MX lookup on "workers.int.example.com" and
# round-robins across the equal-priority MX records.
#
# After editing, rebuild the hash map:
#   postmap /etc/postfix/transport
#   postfix reload

archive.example.com    relay:workers.int.example.com
